## 1. Introduction
VocalDeck ("the App") is a utility application designed to control presentation software via voice commands. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information and the terms under which you use the App.

**By downloading and using VocalDeck, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.**

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

### A. Microphone & Voice Data (Local Processing Only)
The App uses your device’s microphone to detect specific voice commands (including but not limited to **"Next"**, **"Back"**, **"Blank"**, **"Ok Click Next"**, and **"Click Next"**).
* **No Cloud Storage:** All audio processing is performed **locally on your device** (offline) using the Vosk speech recognition engine.
* **No Recording:** We do not record, save, store, or transmit your voice or audio data to any external server.
* **Ephemeral Data:** Audio data is processed in Random Access Memory (RAM) in real-time and is discarded immediately after the command is recognized.

### B. Bluetooth Data
The App uses Bluetooth HID (Human Interface Device) technology to communicate with your paired computer.
* **Direct Connection:** This connection is direct between your phone and your computer.
* **No Logs:** We do not track or log the devices you connect to.

### C. Personal Information
We **do not** collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.

## 3. App Permissions
To function correctly, VocalDeck requires the following permissions:
1.  **RECORD_AUDIO:** Strictly used to listen for navigation commands while the "Listening Mode" is active.
2.  **BLUETOOTH_CONNECT / BLUETOOTH_SCAN:** Required to find and pair with your laptop to send keystrokes.
3.  **FOREGROUND_SERVICE:** Required to keep the Bluetooth connection alive when your screen turns off during a presentation.

## 4. Third-Party Services
* **Google Play Services:** The App uses Google Play Billing Library to process the "PRO" version upgrade. Google handles all financial transactions secure subject to its own privacy policy. We do not have access to your credit card or payment details.
* **Crash Analytics:** Google Play may collect anonymous crash logs and performance data to help us fix bugs. This data is aggregated and does not identify you personally.

## 5. Limitation of Liability (Important)
**The App is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without any warranties of any kind, express or implied.**

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Developer (Vaibhav Deshmukh) and VAKSYS TECHNOLOGIES PVT LTD shall **NOT** be liable for:
1.  **Financial Loss:** Any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use the App (e.g., a failed presentation during a business pitch).
2.  **Errors or Failures:** Any issues arising from Bluetooth interference, battery failure, or software incompatibility.
3.  **Safety:** Accidents or injuries resulting from distraction while using the App.

**You acknowledge that you use VocalDeck at your own risk.** It is your responsibility to test the App in your specific environment before relying on it for critical presentations.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
VocalDeck does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children.
